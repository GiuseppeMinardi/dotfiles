# Dotfiles

In this repository I'm going to put all my dotfiles for my *i3gaps* configuration.
Untill now there are:

- .Xresources
- .vimrc
- .configs/i3/

## Xresorues

Xresources is used for customizing *urxvt*, but the colours are customized using *pywal*, therefore no color information are found in the dotfile.

## vimrc

.vimc contains all my customization for *vim*, vimis my main text editor for markdown, LaTeX, python, bash and, sometimes, R.

## i3 configs

i3 is the folder where my i3 configuration are found. There's nothing fancy, but the colors of the tiles are custommized with *pywal*.
I will also put a new bar.
