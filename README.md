# Dotfiles

In this repository I'm going to put all my dotfiles for my *i3gaps* configuration.
Untill now there are:

- .Xresources
- .vimrc
- .configs/
	- i3/
	- polybar/

## Xresorues

Xresources is used for customizing *urxvt*, but the colours are customized using *pywal*, therefore no color information are found in the dotfile.

## vimrc

.vimc contains all my customization for *vim*, vimis my main text editor for markdown, LaTeX, python, bash and, sometimes, R.

## i3 configs

i3 is the folder where my i3 configuration ar stored.
It's a normal i3 configs, the special thing is the *pywal* snippets that hanges the colors of the tiles and the terminal according to the background image.

## polybar configs
Polybar is the folder where my polybar configuration are stored.
There are also two script, the first runs polybar as suggested by the creator and the second lauches *spotify-now* that display author and itle of the song reproduced by he program.

# Disclamer

The files are poorly commented and are a bit messy.
